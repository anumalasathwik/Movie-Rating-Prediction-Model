Introduction
Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP), often used to gauge opinions from text data. This project builds a model to predict whether a movie review is positive or negative based on its content, leveraging deep learning techniques.

Dataset
The project uses the IMDb Movie Reviews dataset, which contains 50,000 movie reviews labeled as either positive or negative.

Note: The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from Kaggle.

Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

Movie Rating Prediction Model.ipynb: The main notebook for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
data/: Directory to store the dataset (not included in the repository).
models/: Directory to save trained models (optional).
Installation
To run this project, you'll need to install the following Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn keras nltk
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-rating-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd movie-rating-prediction
Download the dataset and place it in the data/ directory.

Open the Jupyter notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Movie Rating Prediction Model.ipynb
Run all cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

Results
The project results in a binary classification model capable of predicting whether a movie review is positive or negative. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
